# model
A model in Django is a Python class that represents a database table.
It is the single, definitive source of information about your data.
It contains the essential fields and behaviors of the data you're storing.
Models define the structure of stored data, including field types, defaults, options, etc.
Each model maps to a single database table.

# retriving data from models
```python
val = Modelname.objects.all() # to get all
```

```python
val = Modelname.objects.get(seatsching_parameter = "something") # to get filtered
```

# Superuser
```cmd
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
> A Django superuser is a special kind of user account that has full administrative access to all parts of your Django project â€” especially the Django admin panel.

## Superuser Permissions:
- Can log into the admin panel (/admin/).
- Can view, add, edit, delete any model's data.
- Can create or manage other users (including staff and other superusers).
- Has all permissions by default, without needing to be explicitly assigned.
